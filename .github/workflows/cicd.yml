# A simple workflow to build and test the frontend application
name: Frontend CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This job is named "build-and-test-frontend"
  build-and-test-frontend:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Set the default working directory for all run steps in this job
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./frontend

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 1. Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: ⬇️ Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up the specified version of Node.js
      - name: 🟢 Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: frontend/package-lock.json

      # 3. Installs project dependencies using 'npm ci' for faster, reliable installs
      - name: 📦 Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # 4. Runs tests if a "test" script exists in package.json
      - name: 🧪 Run tests
        run: npm test --if-present

      # 5. Runs the build script to create a production version of your app
      - name: 🔨 Build for production
        run: npm run build --if-present
